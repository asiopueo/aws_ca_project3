# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.
Moving the webapp instance into a private subnet.


# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.
A S3 buckets may still be accessed from outside if a user from the same account is being authenticated. Hence, it could help but no guarantee higher security.


# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?
Enabling default encryption only effects objects which are inserted to the storage afterwards. There are two choices to circumvent this: Either re-upload the object, or copy it over itself.


# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.
Instead of the new architecture, the initial configuration would be redeployed.
